# SASS

## COMPONENTS

are building blocks which are independent and reusable everywhere across the website

## Layout

is what holds all of these components together

# RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN

- is a technique that we can use to make a webpage,adjust its layout, and its visual style to any possible screen size.
- in practice means that responsive web design makes websites usable on all possible kinds of devices.

## RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN PRINCIPLES

### FLUID LAYOUTS

- to allow webpage to adapt to the current viewport width or height
- use % or vh/vw unit instead of px for elements that should adapt to viewport (usually layout)
- use max-width instead of width

### RESPONSIVE UNITS

- use rem unit instead of px for most lengths
- to make it easy to scale the entire layout down (or up) automatically

### FLEXIBLE IMAGES

- by default, images don't scale automatically as we change the viewport, se we need to fix that
- always use % for image dimensions, together with the max-width property

### MEDIA QUERIES

- to change CSS styles on certain viewport widths (called breakpoints)

# GRID

- is just a design system which allows us to build consistent interfaces
- will allow us to devide our available space into two equal parts and three equal parts or in four equal parts or 1/2 and 1/3.
